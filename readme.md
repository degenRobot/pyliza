# Pyliza

A basic AI Agent framework (WIP) based on [Eliza](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza)

## Getting Started 

1. Clone the repo

2. Start poetry shell i.e. `poetry shell`

3. Add environment variables - see `.env.example`

4. Configure `config.py` to your liking
    Note this contains logic for the personality, speech, goals and initial thoughts of the agent. 


## To Do 

Note code is extremely messy and not well-organised - will clean up at some point. 

Some other items to add include 
- More sophisticated memory handling 
- More sophisticated prompting (esp for the LLM)
- More sophisticated twitter handling (esp for replying to tweets)
- Logging 
- Error handling 
- Tests 
- On chain actions (e.g. using Silverback by ApeWorx : https://github.com/ApeWorX/silverback)
